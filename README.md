# Linear Programming for Balancing Healthy Diet, Price, and Nutrient Consumption
Nutrient LP

In recent years there has been a rising popularity in eating a "plant-based" diet (see figure below) [8], due to increased prevalance of chronic conditions stemming from lifelong adherance to the Standard American Diet (SAD). Maintaining a healthy diet regimine like the Medteranian, Paleo, Autoimmune Protocol, or other anti-inflammatory, produce-rich diet is important for maintaining overall health. Vegetable-rich diets are also known to prevent and reverse chronic diseases that stem from a multitude of factors, including eating a diet rich in processed foods like the SAD.

One practical question that arises when people switch from the SAD full of cheap processed and pre-packaged foods to a healthier one filled with fresh foods is, how much (extra) is this going to cost me? Another practical question when switching to a non-SAD diet is, can I meet all of my reccommended dietary allowance for the necessary nutrients?

This program aims to come up with a list of foods within a certain diet regimine that meet recommended daily allowance for nutrients and recommmended daily calories for gender, age, and activity, while minimizing cost.
